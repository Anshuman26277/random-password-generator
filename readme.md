Password Generator Script
This script generates a random password of a user-specified length. The password consists of digits (0-9), some letters (a, b, c), and a special character (@).

Features
Generates a random password based on the provided length.
Handles invalid input gracefully.
Ensures passwords are created using a mix of digits, letters, and a special character for basic diversity.
Usage
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

2. Running the Script
Copy the script into a Python file, e.g., password_generator.py.

Run the script in a terminal or command prompt using:

bash
Copy code
python password_generator.py
Enter the desired password length when prompted.

The script will generate and display a random password.

Example
bash
Copy code
Enter the desired password length: 8
Generated Password: b07@312a
Error Handling
If a non-integer value is entered for the password length, the script will prompt:

Copy code
Please enter a valid number.
If the entered length is 0 or less, the script returns:
mathematica
Copy code
Invalid length. Length should be greater than 0.
Customization
You can modify the pool of characters used for generating passwords by updating this line in the script:

python
Copy code
password = ''.join(random.choices('abc@0123456789', k=length))
For instance, to include uppercase letters or additional symbols:

python
Copy code
password = ''.join(random.choices('abc@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!0123456789', k=length))
Dependencies
No external dependencies are required. The script uses Python's built-in random module.
